# OpenAI Q&A App with Streamlit

This app provides an interactive question answering interface using OpenAI's language models via the Langchain client. It is built with Streamlit for a simple yet powerful GUI.

## Usage
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies (see requirements.txt)
3. Run streamlit run app.py
4. Provide your OpenAI API key
5. Enter questions/text and submit
6. See responses generated by the model

## Features
1. Sidebar for API key input
2. Text area for queries
3. Submit button to trigger response
4. Displays responses inline
5. Caches responses for faster queries

## Architecture
The frontend is built entirely with Streamlit components. User input is sent to the Langchain client which initializes OpenAI and generates responses. These are returned and displayed.

## Customization
You can modify the model, temperature or input different text samples. Multiple LLMs like ChatGPT, Codex could also be compared.

## Potential Enhancements
1. User auth
2. Pagination for large responses
3. Integrate summarization/filtering
4. Deploy as web app for broader use
5. Add support for other tasks like code completions

This app serves as a starting template to build conversational tools on Streamlit with Langchain.
